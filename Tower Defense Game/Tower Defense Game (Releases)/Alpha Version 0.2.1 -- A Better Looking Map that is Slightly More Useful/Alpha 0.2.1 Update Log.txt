Alpha Version 0.2.1 -- "A Better Looking Map that is Slightly More Useful" -- July 19th, 2017 6:45 AM Central Standard Time

Intentions for Alpha and Beyond:
	-My goal for the alpha verion of the game is to make a playable game that works. It will more than likely not be pretty and always smooth, but it will work (most
	of the time).
	-For beta I'll look to make the game cleaner and less like an 8bit game from the 80s. Additionally I'll be expanding on the features of the game from just basic test
	maps, towers, enemies, etc. to a more complete list that would be expected of a full game. I'll also stream line the usability of all aspects of the game, as well as
	refine and rework the core game logic to be complete and smooth.
	-For the complete release of the game out of the development stage, the game should look and feel complete. There should be minimal bugs, no obvious issues, and not
	have a "this doesn't feel polished" look to it. Obviously it won't be perfect and I anticipate to update it more after release.

Overview (My interpretation of the update):
	-I've been thinking about how I want to start tackling the game logic for the game. Through this thought I decided that a good portion of the map can be static and
	will not need to be updated so I started implementing them straight into the map. Also as a first step of game logic I refined the click detection to a tile coordinate
	system in addition to standard coordinates to make placing towers on the tiles much easier when implemented in the future.

New Features/ Changes (Features that have been implemented into the game since the last update or changed.):
	-Added first portion of UI for "Test Map" (non functional)
	-Added mouse click detection in "Test Map"

Code Tweaks (Things that I have done to the code since the last update.):
	-Created a new file for the game logic:					game_logic.py
	-Added function to run game logic in game_logic.py:			logic()
	-Added function to detect mouse clicks on "Test Map" in game_logic.py:	get_cords_of_click(x,y)
	-Added code for turtles to draw out the first portion of UI for "Test Map"

Current Known Bugs (Bugs that are in the game that I know of and am in the process of fixing.):
	-When I run the game in a location other than my desktop the "Reset" button and the "No" button under the "Exit" button just close the game rather than reseting
	it. (I have not tested it on a computer other than mine. Seems to be an issue with the directory of the game "no duh").

	-You have to press the "Start" and "End" Buttons twice for them to work. (Not necessarily a bug, but I do not know how to work around it at the moment.)

	-If you press the "Start" button the game thinks that every click after that is on the start button.

	-Reseting the game either through the "Reset" button or the "No" button under the "Exit" button closes the entire window and reopens it instead of just refreshing 
	the window. (Not necessarily a bug, but at the moment I do not know how to reset the window any other way.)

	-If you press where the "No" button is under the "Exit" button before you press the "Exit" button it still resets the game. (I do not know why it is doing this
	and as of now I don't have a solution.)

	-On the bottom side of the map the tiles are not even.

Upcoming Features (Current outlook of what features will be added to the game. Not set in stone and might be scrapped or postponed!):
	-Finish "Test Map" UI
	-Implementation of rudimentary game logic
