# Welcome to my GitHub Repository!
## What is this Repository?
This is my personal repo. It comprises a random nonsensical assortment of projects that I typically start when I am procrastinating and will never finish. Feel free to take a look around, but, be warned, I am not a programmer. If you know what you are doing or have OCD please pace yourself if necessary. I am also not an english aficionado, so I apologize in advance for that too. Especially, my comma usage and spelling. I will also through in semicolon sometimes; it just depends whether I think I remeber there being a rule to use them in that spot or not.
